                <p class="MarginXFHSSS">My name is Sankalp Kumar and I am currently a sophomore here at Dublin High School, my goal is to become an engineer, I am taking engineering courses here at Dublin High School to help me decide what kind of engineer I want to be. Also I am doing many activities that I enjoy such as playing tennis. I want to become an engineer because I really enjoy making products, testing products, and problem solving. I also have been surrounded by computers my whole life, so over time it has grown on me and I have developed an interest and liking for computers and other electronics.</p>
                <br />
                <p class="MarginXFHSSS">I am very responsible and reliable because I complete all tasks that are assigned to me and consistently give quality work when I am assigned a task. I am very flexible, so I can adapt to deadlines and change my role if it benefits the team when working in one. Also I work well in teams and have worked on many projects in groups such as the recycled racecar, that me and my group built and modeled. I also am very punctual and I always show up on time no matter what and finish tasks that are assigned to me on time.</p> 
                <br />
                <p class="MarginXFHSSS">I am skilled in using Autodesk Inventor and skilled at using multiple different programming languages such as Python, Html, CSS, Scratch, MIT App Inventor 2, and Command Line. I have modeled many projects in Inventor such as the puzzle cube and the mousetrap. I have programmed projects in various programming languages such as a web game and an android app. I am very versatile in using these tools and good at making  files and programs in these tools and if needed on a team project I can take on various different roles, if it will benefit the team.  Some of my projects I have worked on at Dublin High include the puzzle cube I had to make and model in Autodesk Inventor and the recycled racecar that me and my team built and modeled in Inventor. Other projects that I have worked on was a mousetrap that had to be modeled in Autodesk Inventor and an online platformer game that had to be coded in the programming language Scratch.</p>

                        <p>Duration: 8/29/17-9/4/2017 </p>
                        <p>Objective: Make a game or story in Scratch.</p>

                <p class="container">For the Scratch project, me and my partner had to create a game or story in <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> that was based off a game that had already been made or make a game or story from the ground up. For this project we were given a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1e1qtGq_nrz00wutjM_OWLSzAnqsutTfe52O_7IlE7yA">document</a> with the instructions/guidelines and a rubric that we would be graded with. In addition to creating either a game or story we were also required to make <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1e1qtGq_nrz00wutjM_OWLSzAnqsutTfe52O_7IlE7yA">documentation</a> for this project. Our game that we created was called The Race for First, and it was a multiplayer platformer game with two players. The goal of this game was to get the most points, this was done by completing each level faster than the other player. Throughout this project I learned many things which include critical thinking and problem solving. I also learned that programming takes time and is done well when it is not rushed. I also learned  the importance of good communication as it really helped me and my partner get this project done fast, efficiently, and on time. Finally I learned that it is important to stay on the same page as your partner as it really limits the amount of confusion that can occur and limits the number of problems that could arise.</p>

                <p class="container">For this project I was the project manager, Each person in my group had to design our individual train car based on a central theme everyone in our group had to follow. We were also given a presentation with <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vYu6m6RE8yAlI-X6jcp3bfoNXNoY4qRwEqUCuBbgqro"  target="_blank">instructions</a> as well as a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VaHxH_kCaNUTI2MrI41KAUtFBky95YzUQPO9ZTeageM" target="_blank">design brief</a>  for our project. For this project we were tasked to design, create, make a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByuKOgpyYO_LY3ZiLURlZVd3bDA"  target="_blank">video of the train driving</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1awtjy2vEMFclACG7ZqgqfNF0ZS1pDIoReM5vI_qGJC4"  target="_blank">a gantt chart</a>, and assemble a downloadable online toy train. The overall theme of our car was space as we thought it would be fun and unique. The first train car we made was a rocket car which was designed to be the engine in the train. The second toy train car was the train car I created, it was a space shuttle which was designed to be a passenger car. The next car was a space rover and it was designed to be dining car. The last car was a satellite car which was designed to be a storage car with rotating solar panels for an added effect. Each person in the group was also required to make a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OWk5XhDu_Q-0jjBZrNLovJz5JwPS_OYUdMQ5Kx4Oyzw" target="_blank">rendered image of their train</a> car, drawing files for the train car, as well as <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=15sUfMpMJf0ZEtRGzh_CZaq8rBk9fUkekguOkys2pACY" target="blank">document our whole train on a google presentation</a>. We were also required to make a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1iCl_DyccwSogpB5qakcoTOKYYYb5Nop1VaI6OH-PJ-E" target="_blank">histogram</a> with statistics we got in class for our presentation. Throughout this whole project I learned a lot from Managing a team to advanced modeling inventor, using drive constraints, as well as using drive constraints to make wheels move.</p>

                <p class="container">For the Entrepreneurship Project, me and my partner had to create a new invention or an innovation to a current invention. For this project we were given <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1F0MPOK21HrhgS42JZAbome51yObEmNbWPuNsx0AbkFE" target="blank">instructions</a>, and everything else was up to us. Our project was called Project F and it was a fidget spinner attached to a battery pack. The Fidget spinner attached to the battery pack generates electricity for the battery pack when being spun. The fidget Spinner was attached to the battery pack the same way a windmill is, using a shaft, which is then connected through a series of gears and a generator. The battery pack could then charge phones and other mobile devices through the USB out port. The battery pack could also be plugged into an outlet and charged that way as well for versatility through its USB type C port. The goals for this project were to make something that could make people entertained, as well as making sure their mobile devices can stay charged up. We also had to make a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=18647VlJYwXl8XyZ3Sq5cJjKdycSxY8GfMOAn7bDzwQM" target="_blank">presentation</a> as well as do <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1s3SC0bCOBUxnj8IHnQ6WzN-3-MlWKtJHH7DEm6kiNRc" target="blank">documentation</a> for our product. Throughout this project I learned many things from advanced modeling in inventor, making complicated models, as well as constraining gears together.</p>

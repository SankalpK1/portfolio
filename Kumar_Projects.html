                <p class="container">For the Scratch project, me and my partner had to create a game or story in <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> that was based off a game that had already been made or make a game or story from the ground up. For this project we were given a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1e1qtGq_nrz00wutjM_OWLSzAnqsutTfe52O_7IlE7yA">document</a> with the instructions/guidelines and a rubric that we would be graded with. In addition to creating either a game or story we were also required to make <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1e1qtGq_nrz00wutjM_OWLSzAnqsutTfe52O_7IlE7yA">documentation</a> for this project. Our game that we created was called The Race for First, and it was a multiplayer platformer game with two players. The goal of this game was to get the most points, this was done by completing each level faster than the other player. Throughout this project I learned many things which include critical thinking and problem solving. I also learned that programming takes time and is done well when it is not rushed. I also learned  the importance of good communication as it really helped me and my partner get this project done fast, efficiently, and on time. Finally I learned that it is important to stay on the same page as your partner as it really limits the amount of confusion that can occur and limits the number of problems that could arise.</p>

                Each person in my group had to design our individual train car
                based on a central theme everyone in our group had to follow. 
                We were also given a presentation with <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vYu6m6RE8yAlI-X6jcp3bfoNXNoY4qRwEqUCuBbgqro"  target="_blank">instructions</a>

                For this project we were tasked to design, create, make a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByuKOgpyYO_LY3ZiLURlZVd3bDA"  target="_blank">video

                assemble a downloadable online toy train. The overall theme of our car was space as we thought it would be fun and unique. The first train car we made was a 
                rocket car which was designed to be the engine in the train. The second toy train car was the train car I created, it was a space shuttle which was designed to 
                be a passenger car. The next car was a space rover and it was designed to be dining car. The last car was a satellite car which was designed to be a storage car 
                with rotating solar panels for an added effect. Each person in the group was also required to make a

For this project we were given <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1F0MPOK21HrhgS42JZAbome51yObEmNbWPuNsx0AbkFE" target="blank">instructions</a>, and everything else was up to us. Our project was called Project F and it was a fidget spinner attached to a battery pack. The Fidget spinner attached to the battery pack generates electricity for the battery pack when being spun. The fidget Spinner was attached to the battery pack the same way a windmill is, using a shaft, which is then connected through a series of gears and a generator. The battery pack could then charge phones and other mobile devices through the USB out port. The battery pack could also be plugged into an outlet and charged that way as well for versatility through its USB type C port. The goals for this project were to make something that could make people entertained, as well as making sure their mobile devices can stay charged up. We also had to make a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=18647VlJYwXl8XyZ3Sq5cJjKdycSxY8GfMOAn7bDzwQM" target="_blank">presentation</a> as well as do <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1s3SC0bCOBUxnj8IHnQ6WzN-3-MlWKtJHH7DEm6kiNRc" target="blank">documentation</a> for our product. Throughout this project I learned many things from advanced modeling in inventor, making complicated models, as well as constraining gears together.</p>

In addition to creating a text adventure we had to create a flowchart for this project. The text adventure project we created was about a person who is kidnapped who had to find a way out of a warehouse. This text adventure had many different outcomes and only one of the outcomes would lead to the player successfully escaping. Throughout this whole project I learned many things, such as the value of functions and how simple they make programming huge programs. I also learned why limiting the use of nesting if statements makes coding much easier and cleaner.</p>

The objective of this project was to create a chatbot that would respond to certain keywords and would give sensible answers. The chatbot also had to have a theme or area of focus. Me and my group created a bird chatbot. The chatbot would ask a series of questions to the user and then based off responses would ask more specific questions. Eventually the chatbot would give the bird that was requested based off of characteristics. The data for this chatbot was pulled from a csv file that was parsed.</p>

We also had to describe all of the abstract classes, interfaces, and arrays/arraylists we used in our app. The app we created was a stock app which would return to the user daily stock quotes, daily informations of cryptocurrencies, and a news feed on the latest news. The data for this chatbot was retrieved from an api called Alpha Vantage which returned all of the data used.
